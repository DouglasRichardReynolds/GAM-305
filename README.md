# GAM-305
GAM-305 Project Repo

Using Unreal Engine 5.4.4

## Module Two Team Project Plan
Scenario:
Top-Down Shooter Game

Additional Elements:
Enemies (Stationary)
Obstacles (Stationary)
Player Power-up Pickups
Enemies (Moving)

Space theme, aliens invading your ship
Intro cutscene showing player waking up, game ends when player character's partner is saved in last room

Player dies in one hit
Two moving enemies: one moves faster and has less HP, one moves slower and has more HP
Two stationary enemies: turret that shoots a single fast shot, turret that spins and periodically fires shots in each direction
Three pickups: move faster, shoot faster, 1 hit of armor
Four obstacles: tnt barrel that explodes on hit, walls that can prevent movement and block projectiles, fence object that blocks movement but not bullets, bottomless pits that kill whatever fall in

Alpha Development Goal:
A large room that has at least one of each additional element and a playable character, with placeholder assets. Completed build by 7/24

Beta Development Goal:
Every additional element and more rooms, aiming for 5-10 minutes of playtime. Decide on some final assets. Completed build by 7/31

Final build will have all content completely finished and working, with intro and ending cutscenes. finished by 8/7, tested by 8/10.

Communcation:
Discord, text and calls. Aiming to get tasks designated for the week by meeting on Tuesdays. Weekly Scrum and associated sprint.
Using Jira to assign and report on task items.



Anthony Merlini, Harrison Doukas, Douglas Reynolds all collaborated and equally contributed via Discord call on 7/12.

## Module Three QA and Testing Plan

-Play test: Test assets as we develop them (Does it move? Does it have collision? Does it do its job?)
  -Everyone tests the assets as they are creating them, following test checklist for guidance
  -asset testing up to 24 July with release on the 24th for alpha build - test from player's perspective, then try to break assets and look for edge scenarios

-Code release: Merge assets and test for compatibility

-Checklist will be updated as release requirements are discovered

-Jira will be used to track and assign bugs - Avoid pushing bugs in the first place. If they need to be pushed, then report them.

-Test checklist:  
  --Player  
    ---Sub checklist goes here  
    ---Try to be specific with checklist items  
    ---Item 3  
    ---Item 4
